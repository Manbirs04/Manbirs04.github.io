        <h3>Introduction to Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs, the magnificent creatures of the ancient world, have captivated human imagination for centuries. These remarkable reptiles once roamed the Earth, dominating the landscape for millions of years. In this encyclopedia, we delve into the fascinating world of dinosaurs, exploring their history, diversity, and the mysteries that still shroud their existence.

        <h3>Classification of Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs are classified into distinct groups based on their characteristics, and the Mesozoic Era, often called the "Age of Dinosaurs," witnessed the rise and fall of various dinosaur groups. Here, we explore the major dinosaur classifications:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Sauropods</h3>
        <p>
            Sauropods were massive, long-necked dinosaurs known for their immense size and herbivorous diet. Some iconic sauropods include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brachiosaurus:</strong> Recognized for its long neck and height, Brachiosaurus was a herbivore that thrived during the Jurassic period.</li>
            <li><strong>Argentinosaurus:</strong> One of the largest sauropods, it is believed to be among the heaviest land animals ever.</li>
            <li><strong>Apatosaurus:</strong> Often confused with Brontosaurus, Apatosaurus was another giant herbivore.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Theropods</h3>
        <p>
            Theropods were a diverse group of bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs. Some well-known theropods include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tyrannosaurus Rex:</strong> The "T. rex" was one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs, known for its powerful jaws and tiny arms.</li>
            <li><strong>Velociraptor:</strong> Made famous by "Jurassic Park," these dinosaurs were fast and highly intelligent predators.</li>
            <li><strong>Spinosaurus:</strong> With its sail-like structure on its back, Spinosaurus was an apex predator adapted to aquatic environments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Ornithopods</h3>
        <p>
            Ornithopods were herbivorous, bipedal dinosaurs that included a variety of species:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parasaurolophus:</strong> Known for its distinctive crest, this dinosaur may have produced trumpet-like sounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Hadrosaurus:</strong> One of the first dinosaurs discovered in North America, it was a duck-billed herbivore of the Late Cretaceous.</li>
            <li><strong>Edmontosaurus:</strong> A hadrosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period and had a wide geographic range.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Ceratopsians</h3>
        <p>
            Ceratopsians were herbivorous dinosaurs with frills and horns. Notable ceratopsians include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Triceratops:</strong> Recognizable by its three facial horns and frill, Triceratops was a herbivore of the Late Cretaceous.</li>
            <li><strong>Styracosaurus:</strong> Known for its elaborate arrangement of facial spikes, it was a relative of Triceratops.</li>
            <li><strong>Pachyrhinosaurus:</strong> A ceratopsian with a thick nose boss, it was found in North America and Asia.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. Pterosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            While not dinosaurs, pterosaurs were flying reptiles of the Mesozoic Era. They had wingspans ranging from a few inches to over 30 feet and included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pteranodon:</strong> A well-known pterosaur with a large, crest-tipped beak and long wings for gliding.</li>
            <li><strong>Quetzalcoatlus:</strong> One of the largest flying creatures ever, with an estimated wingspan of 33 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhamphorhynchus:</strong> A small, long-tailed pterosaur from the Jurassic period.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>6. Ankylosaurs and Stegosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            Ankylosaurs and stegosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs known for their distinctive armored and spiky appearances:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ankylosaurus:</strong> Named after the tough, osteoderms covering its body, Ankylosaurus was one of the largest ankylosaurs with a massive tail club for defense.</li>
            <li><strong>Stegosaurus:</strong> Known for its double row of large, bony plates along its back and spikes on its tail, Stegosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic period.</li>
            <li><strong>Kentrosaurus:</strong> A smaller stegosaur with prominent spikes that roamed Africa during the Late Jurassic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Mesozoic Era</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs ruled the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which spanned approximately 180 million years. This era is divided into three periods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Triassic Period:</strong> The earliest dinosaurs appeared during the Late Triassic, around 230 million years ago.</li>
            <li><strong>Jurassic Period:</strong> Dinosaurs continued to evolve and diversify during the Jurassic period, which began about
