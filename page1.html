        <p>
            Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that existed on Earth for over 160 million years. They first appeared during the Triassic period, around 230 million years ago, and went extinct around 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. Dinosaurs are a fascinating part of Earth's history, and their study has provided valuable insights into prehistoric life.

        <h3>Classification of Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs can be classified into two main groups:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saurischia (Lizard-Hipped):</strong> This group includes both herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs. The theropods, a sub-group of Saurischia, include some of the most famous carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor.</li>
            <li><strong>Ornithischia (Bird-Hipped):</strong> This group primarily consists of herbivorous dinosaurs. They include well-known dinosaurs like Triceratops and Stegosaurus.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Characteristics of Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs exhibit several distinctive features and behaviors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Size Variation:</strong> Dinosaurs varied greatly in size, from small, chicken-sized dinosaurs to enormous giants like Brachiosaurus and Argentinosaurus.</li>
            <li><strong>Bipedal and Quadrupedal:</strong> Some dinosaurs were bipedal, walking on two legs, while others were quadrupedal, using all four limbs for locomotion.</li>
            <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Dinosaurs had diverse diets. Some were herbivores, feeding on plants, while others were carnivores, preying on other animals.</li>
            <li><strong>Warm-Blooded:</strong> Some dinosaurs are believed to have been warm-blooded, which may have contributed to their success and adaptability.</li>
            <li><strong>Hollow Bones:</strong> Many dinosaurs had lightweight, hollow bones, which aided in mobility and respiration.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Famous Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs have captured the imagination of people worldwide. Here are a few of the most famous dinosaurs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex):</strong> Known as the "tyrant lizard king," T. rex was one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs.</li>
            <li><strong>Brachiosaurus:</strong> A massive, long-necked dinosaur that lived during the Jurassic period.</li>
            <li><strong>Velociraptor:</strong> A small, agile dinosaur with distinctive clawed feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Triceratops:</strong> A herbivorous dinosaur known for its three facial horns and frill.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Legacy and Extinction</h3>
        <p>
            The extinction of dinosaurs, often associated with an asteroid impact, marked the end of the Cretaceous period and the Mesozoic era. However, their legacy lives on through the study of fossils, scientific research, and popular culture. Dinosaurs continue to inspire fascination and curiosity, making them a significant part of Earth's history.
