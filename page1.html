        <p>
            Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth for over 160 million years. They first appeared during the Triassic period, around 230 million years ago, and went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 65 million years ago.

        <h3>Classification of Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs can be categorized into two primary groups:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saurischia (Lizard-Hipped):</strong> This group includes both herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs. Among them are the iconic Tyrannosaurus rex and the long-necked Brachiosaurus.</li>
            <li><strong>Ornithischia (Bird-Hipped):</strong> These dinosaurs were mostly herbivorous and included species like Triceratops and Stegosaurus.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dinosaur Diversity</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs exhibited a remarkable range of sizes and adaptations. Some of the notable examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sauropods:</strong> Enormous, long-necked herbivores like Argentinosaurus.</li>
            <li><strong>Theropods:</strong> Carnivorous dinosaurs, such as Velociraptor and Spinosaurus.</li>
            <li><strong>Ornithopods:</strong> Herbivores like Parasaurolophus and Edmontosaurus, known for their chewing adaptations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dinosaur Behavior</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs displayed a range of behaviors, including nesting, herding, and hunting. Some dinosaurs were social and traveled in groups, while others were solitary hunters.
        </p>
        <h3>Dinosaur Habitats</h3>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs occupied diverse habitats, from lush forests to arid deserts. They adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions.
        </p>
        <h3>Notable Dinosaurs</h3>
        <p>
            Some of the most famous dinosaurs include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex):</strong> The "tyrant lizard king" was one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs.</li>
            <li><strong>Brachiosaurus:</strong> A massive, long-necked dinosaur from the Jurassic period.</li>
            <li><strong>Velociraptor:</strong> Small, agile dinosaurs known for their distinctive clawed feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Triceratops:</strong> Herbivorous dinosaurs with three facial horns and frills.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Legacy and Extinction</h3>
        <p>
            The extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period, often associated with an asteroid impact, marked the end of the Mesozoic era. However, their legacy lives on through the study of fossils, scientific research, and popular culture.
